Chargeable User Identity|string|As defined in RFC-4372. The CUI is used to associate a unique identifier with a user so that the user can be identified (for billing, authentication or other purposes when roaming outside of their home network.
Acct-Interim-Interval|32-bit unsigned integer|When present, it enables the transmission of RADIUS accounting requests of the Interim Update type. Specify the number of seconds between each transmission.
Session-Timeout|32-bit unsigned integer|Maximum time a session can be active. The user must re-authenticate when this timer expires. Omitting this attribute or specifying 0 disables the feature.
Idle-Timeout|32-bit unsigned integer|Maximum idle time in seconds allowed for the user. Once reached, the user session is terminated with termination-cause IDLE-TIMEOUT. Omitting the attribute or specifying 0 disables the feature.
Class|string|As defined in RFC 2865. Multiple instances are supported.
EAP-Message|string|Supported only when authentication is 802.1X or EAP-MD5. Note that the content will not be read as the RADIUS Access Accept is overriding whatever the indication is contained inside this packet.
MS-MPPE-Recv-Key||As defined by RFC 3078.
MS-MPPE-Send-Key||As defined by RFC 3078.
Termination-Action||As defined by RFC 2865. If set to 1, a new Access Request is sent. If an Access Accept is returned, the service controller then extends the user’s session timeout, and if applicable, session quotas according the value returned by the RADIUS server.
Colubris-AVPair||See “HP vendor-specific attributes” on page 48.
Tunnel-Type||Only used when assigning a specific VLAN number to a user. In this case it must be set to VLAN.
Tunnel-Medium-Type||Only used when assigning a specific VLAN number to a user. In this case it must be set to 802.
Tunnel-Private-Group-ID||Only used when assigning a specific VLAN number to a user. In this case it must be set to the VLAN ID.
